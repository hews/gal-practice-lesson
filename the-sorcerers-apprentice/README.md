---

### Activity

In this activity you have to use the magic of `#map` to transform data. Turn the
given tests green and prove your new-found skill!

### Setup

As always, `npm install`!

There are two files provided: `sorcery.js` and `sorcerySpec.js`. 
Run the specs first (with `mocha sorcerySpec.js` or `npm test`),
and then do your work in `sorcery.js`.

*Try to finish through [Part 2][p2].*

### Stretch Goals

##### Answer the following

- How did you structure your code? For example, did you use inline 
  anonymous functions? How long were your functions? What refactoring 
  did you do, or could you do, to make your code more clear?

##### Solve the following

Can you complete the pending specs through [Part 3][p3]?
